# py4swiss

`py4swiss` is a pairing engine for chess tournaments
using the [(Swiss) Dutch System](https://handbook.fide.com/chapter/C0403Till2026).

The code is heavily inspired by [bbpPairings](https://github.com/BieremaBoyzProgramming/bbpPairings)
and also directly utitlizes the maximum weight matching algorithm implemented in there.

This is a work in progress.
